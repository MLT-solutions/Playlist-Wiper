**How to Master Playlist Wiper**

**Preparation:**
1.  Open the target website (e.g., YouTube Playlist).
2.  **CRITICAL:** Position your browser window exactly where you want it. Do not move or resize it once recording starts.
3.  Launch **Playlist Wiper**. It will stay "Always on Top."

**Step 1: The Recording Phase**
1.  Look at the action you want to perform. (Example: Clicking a menu dot, then clicking 'Remove').
2.  Press **F2** on your keyboard. The status text will turn RED.
3.  Perform the sequence of clicks **once**.
    * *Click 1: The 'Three Dots' menu.*
    * *Click 2: The 'Remove from Playlist' button.*
4.  Press **F2** again immediately after finishing the sequence. The status text will turn GREEN.

**Step 2: Configuration**
1.  **Repeats:** How many items do you want to remove? (e.g., 50).
2.  **Gap (s):** How long does the website take to refresh after a click?
    * *Tip:* YouTube takes about 1-2 seconds to remove a video. Set this to **2.0** to be safe. If you set it too fast, the clicks might miss while the page is loading.

**Step 3: Execution**
1.  Press **F3** (or click "Run Loop").
2.  **HANDS OFF!** Don't touch the mouse. Watch the magic happen.
3.  To stop early, press **F3** again or drag your mouse hard to the top-left corner of the screen.

**Troubleshooting:**
* *The mouse is clicking empty space!* -> You likely scrolled the page or moved the window. Reset (F3 to stop) and re-record (F2).
* *It's clicking too fast!* -> Increase the "Gap" setting.
